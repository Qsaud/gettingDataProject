--Data source:
The data eas obtained from the link below:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


--Variables Interpretation:
 
 X, Y, Z: the axis of X, Y and Z (signals can be in the X, Y and Z directions) 
 t (at the beginning of the variable names): time domain signals 
 f (at the beginning of the variable names): frequency domain signals 
 mean: Mean value 
 std: Standard deviation 
 meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean 
frequency 
 angle: Angle between to vectors 
 Acc: Acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer (sensor signal). 
 Gyr: Angular velocity from the smartphone gyroscope (sensor signal). 
 Body: The signals related to the body of subject (individual) who has been examined. 
 Jerk: Jerk signals (the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in 
time to reach this signal) 
 Mag: magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm 
 Gravity: The signals related to the gravity. 
 Subject: The numbers between 1 to 30 which are identifiers of the subjects 
(individuals) who carried out the experiment. 
 Activity: including 6 activities performed by subjects (STANDING, SITTING, 
LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)

--Data transformation and clean up.

The R code file is working on the data provided to:

1. 1- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set:
Using mainly "merge" Function

2-Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 Using mainly "grep" and "gsub" functions

 3- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
By assigning the activities in the file "activity_labels.txt" to the tables names.


4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Then binding all columns together in one data set called "merged_data.txt”


5- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
By finding the nuber of subjects and the number of the activity using the "unique" function ,the using a loop to find the mean of each activity for each subject using the "colMeans" function
